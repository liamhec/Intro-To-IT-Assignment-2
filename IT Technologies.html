      <h2> Autonomous Vehicles </h2>
      <p>
        <h4> What does it do? </h4>
         Autonomous vehicles are profound in all facets of the transportation medium. In regards to Cars, Tesla the
  Vehicle company which produces cars that allow for semi-autonomous control which rely on a multiplex of
  Cameras in correlation with line, object and vehicle tracking. Alongside the camera technologies Tesla also utilizes
  Radar for object feedback and ultrasonic sensors for positioning feedback also. These sensors allow for the car to follow a lane automatically, detect people and cars in order to avoid collision and adjust throttle outputs in order to match
  Traffic speed etc. Whilst in the case of Tesla in particular, the vehicles require the drivers to be awake and fully coherent whilst these automated processes are in fruition, in the next few years Elon Must (Tesla's CEO) has stated that they
  Are developing towards a fully autonomous vehicle that follows pre-planned routes and paths without human interaction in order to achieve full automation by the year of 2020. According to Elon it must be the push for the car manufacturers to correlate their cars in relevance to each other on the road in order to achieve a common protocol in which such autonomous vehicles would follow in disposition to allow for no human to automated system judgment overlaps to occur. This means that the aim would be for a common travel system to be developed and followed, similar to how trains all follow a line and adjust speed and timing accordingly to minimise and reduce tunnel traffic and collision. Furthermore whilst Teslas can currently only follow a simple relatively straight path, it is also their future goals to allow for better environmental awareness from the sensors on the car and more depth of the vehicles own situational awareness in order to be autonomous even throughout busy suburban roads and intersections frequented by people alongside winding roads.

  In continuation, with further regards to the uprise of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (drones), there has recently been great developments to automation with GPS followed paths and collision avoidance being implemented even within commercial low end products such as DJI. Using DJI as an example, we are able to see a platform which requires very little human input to follow a set path of waypoints via GPS and take photos at each point. Whilst many of the situational issues such as high wind and legal issues have held back the manufacturer from full automation, they have achieved so anyway through such previous GPS waypoint methods, as long as the user maintain the ability to manually control it and maintains a visual line of sight (VLOS). The goal for DJI is for their drones to eventually be able to follow a pre-planned task without human interactive. In regards to legislation, this enforces that technologically the drones must have a backup of redundancy for almost all aspects of the flight controls in case the vehicles goes AWOL.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4> What is the likely impact? </h4>
      The impact of fully autonomous vehicles on the world would be of great magnitude. Initially, in regards to driverless vehicles, the way in which people approach and look at cars currently will be obselete. With driverless cars currently boasting the ability to be electrically charged at stations, this may put petroleum manufacturers at stress due to the sought after ability eluded to by Elon Musk for the cars to be able to go and charge themselves when not in use by the owner, decreasing the need for petrol in the car industry. This would force redundancy and the decommissioning of some oil rigs which account for the petrol consumed by cars in the future. However, the affect in a positive manner will be that humans may be able to travel further by car without fatigue and even remove the chances of accidents caused by fatigue. Thereby reducing vehicle induced trauma. In contradiction to this estimation of potential impact, the rates of death caused by cars may also go up. Due to the technologies being quite immature, the eventual protocols in which the cars follow for safe travel autonomously, there may be issues and thus be quite unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
     In regards to the personal effect of specifically autonomous cars, it will induce positive changes in sleeping patterns, organisation and transport legalities. Firstly, due to the driverless car eventually requiring no user inputs, it would be assumed that one would be able to sleep during their daily commute. Thereby allowing for more sleep and better mental health. Secondly, organisation would be increased. Due to not having to constantly attending to the car whilst in movement to a location, other tasks will be able to be completed  by the traveller as the car drives itself, this may be things such as work, communication to others etc. Finally, whilst currently it is required for learner drivers to begin at the age of 16, due to cars being able to drive themselves, it may induce changes in the law and allow for children to travel alone in a car on a pre-planned route by their parents. Affecting the future generations of family. </p>

  <h2> Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. </h2>
  <p>
    <h4>What does it do? </h4>
     Our future is shaped by the actions and decisions we make today, our developments and innovations today allow us to see how technology may be able to change and evolve with us. An innovative idea that is being used today that might have a great impact on our future is the idea of cryptocurrency. This is a form of currency which has no physical form, it is instead a form of digital currency which exists only on computers. It works similar to a debit or credit card in regards to purchasing things, however instead of your money passing through a bank and the information being recorded in a ledger, it is instead recorded with an algorithm. The money is transferred through peers and are recorded on a digital public leger called "blockchain" which results In it being decentralised meaning it is controlled by the users with a computer algorithm and not by banks. Cryptocurrencies are stored in online wallets, called "cryptocurrency wallets" and they are involved when users send transactions to each other. There are many advantages to cryptocurrency and main ones include; they are almost impossible to counterfeit, it is also a secure way to transfer money anywhere in the world, your personal information does not need to be tied with your transactions. Presently, cryptocurrencies are not used everywhere yet, with limited stores accepting the payment through cryptocurrencies however in 3 years time, I believe that cryptocurrency will be more widely used and accepted. The advantages allow it to be a functioning development in society and through the use of cryptocurrency we can thrive by accepting and developing new software to aid us in pushing the cryptocurrency craze.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
      The likely impact of cryptocurrency will affect almost everyone in the world. The reason it will affect everyone is because that it is a form of "universal" currency, conversion rates will not be taken into account and as a result the idea of not needing to lose any money through converting money from one currency to another. If cryptocurrency were to succeed, then banks and government issued currencies may become useless and as a result many banking jobs may become redundant, however more opportunities may open up for people in regulating certain cryptocurrencies. By converting to crypto currency in the future may cause banks to become unnecessary and as a result will no longer be used. This will prove to be unfortunate for those who work in banks as their jobs will be lost. However although this may cause jobs to be lost, the possibilities for other jobs relating to cryptocurrencies may arise.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
      If crypto currency is to hit off within the next few years, then this may impact me in many ways. Firstly, the most important factor would be to adjust to the new system of purchasing and trading with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. This will take the longest to adjust to because we as a community have all spent our lives trading with money and to suddenly change it will most certainly cause some issues. Secondly, by adjusting to the cryptocurrency trend, we would need to convert our money into something that can be used to actually purchase things and in this case it would be crypto currency. This process of exchanging all our money over to cryptocurrencies may take the longest period of time. Another problem I can see occurring would be the homeless population would not be able to access any form of money. This will result in poverty rates potentially increasing and will not help our overall economy.

  <h2> Cyber security </h2>
  <p>
    <h4> What does it do? </h4>
     Cybersecurity is all about protecting data from various vulnerabilities, such as hard drive failures, to attacks. Cybersecurity is continuously evolving to protect against new threats that arise. Many systems are developed to be protected against attacks that aim to steal user's data, which is known as an attack on confidentiality. Another attack known as an attack on integrity aims to sabotage to data, whether it be through corrupting data or simply just changing the data wo be incorrect. The third cyber threat is known as an attack on availability which aims to prevent users from accessing the data that they access the most. The most common form of this is ransomware. These attacks are carried out in a various of ways, such as phishing. Phishing aims to trick a user into revealing their personal information, such as an email asking for the user's credentials. Unpatched software can leave user's exposed and vulnerable. This form of attack takes advantage of those who have failed to keep their software update. Hackers are able to exploit any vulnerabilities in the software to get access to various programs and information that they're after. There are many areas of cybersecurity, with different strategies on how to stay protected. Critical infrastructure includes power plants and water supplies, cloud security protects data that is stored in a cloud, while application security aims to protect the data within various programs of a business. There are many ways for users to stay protected in an online world, such as protecting passwords with two-factor authentication, or keeping software up to date. Many organisations have a security analyst whose job is to plan and implement new security measures, while protecting information from unauthorized access. Many organisations hire people known as “white hat hackers”, these hackers are asked to attempt to hack into the organisations infrastructure, so security vulnerabilities can be identified, and patched so the information remains safe. Cybersecurity is a part of everyday life in the I.T industry, with new threats continually being identified and fixed, but also new threats being created. Within this industry it is up to security analysts to find ways to disarm the threats. Software developers also need to be conscious of threats as they are creating a program, to ensure that the create a program that contains little to no threats. As threats become more sophisticated in the future, the need for cyber security analysts will grow, and this part of the I.T industry will grow with it, in order to protect data, and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4> What is the likely impact? </h4>
       Cybersecurity impacts everyone who uses any sort of technology. The main aim to protect user data, through various ways. Organisations take protection of user data very seriously and implement ways to ensure that there is no unauthorized access within the system.  Cybersecurity is continually evolving, and changing, to keep up with the latest threats. As new threats arise within the information technology (I.T) industry, the cybersecurity industry is read to adapt to it. Cyber security is creating jobs within the I.T industry. Some of these jobs include security engineer's and security analyst's. These jobs ensure that there are people keeping up with current threats, and the ability to find ways to remove the threats. The most recent change in cybersecurity is related to cloud security. The need for data to be protected while it is not stored locally has increased rapidly. Data needs to be protected while it is being sent or received, and it cannot be intercepted along the way. This is often completed using end to end encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
    <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
      In daily life, everyone is affected. Anyone who has a bank account or uses social media, know that there is a cyber security team working behind the scenes to ensure the protection of user data. Many organisations recommend users use two factor authentications for accounts, which might include entering your password, then a code that is sent as a text message to log in, preventing unauthorized access to accounts. Software companies such as Apple or Microsoft continually monitor the latest threats, and release operating system updates to users, most time before a threat is even known by the community. Users are constantly reminded about the importance of different passwords, and ways in which they can help to protect their own data. Such as continually changing their password, and using two factor authentications to sign in. Users are also reminded to ensure they are running latest updates of software, to ensure they are protected against the latest threats. </p>


  <h2> Robots </h2>
    <p>
    <h4> What does it do? </h4>
      The evolution of robots is one of the most fast-growing types of technologies there is. There are new types of robots being developed everyday by all people around the world. Weather that being robots being able to assist and help people on day to tasks such as house tasks to a much larger scale robots being used for military or emergency use (to replace robots with jobs that are too dangerous for humans to do); they're more precise and consistent than humans. Robots are made to increase productivity, accuracy, and endurance.
      <br> Most robots today are used to complete simpler tasks rather than what they will be able to do in the future. We might not have the technology in 2018 to create robots that we see in sci-fi films but we will in the near future. When creating a robot, they must not be able to injure a human or allow a human to come to harm. They must obey orders given by the creator and a robot must protect its own existence. These are also known as the three laws of robotics. </br>
      <br> There are multiple uses for robots that can help and assist society in different ways. Some examples are:
        <br> -	Nano-robots are micro sized so they can work in small spaces to complete a task. At the moment nano-bots are still being developed. They are mainly being used for to perform surgical procedures that are too difficult for a human to complete. They will be able to complete tasks such as entering the blood stream to operate and other small-scaled and other difficult procedures.
        <br> -	Artificial Intelligence is also being given to the robotic technology. This allows robots to act with human-like behaviour. Some examples include facial recognition and playing a game where the game responds in response to the players actions. For example, in today's date; there is currently a study where nano-sized robots shaped as fish are performing in a river in Spain. Where they work as a team to give the purity levels of the water to scientists to let them know if the water is habitual for fish to live in, and if not will lead the fish another section of river that is liveable.
        These are just some examples of robotics that have being developed in the last few years. But with the advancement of technology there will be robots that we would have never of thought about and that they will come true. A few decades ago, it was almost impossible to believe that people would be working on self-driving cars. In 2018 and beyond, this will become a normal part of society to own a self-driving car – as they are slowly already being implemented in 2018.</br>
        <br> The future of robots of the future will be eventually take over some people jobs. Such as cooking at home and cleaning the house – there will be robots that will be able to do this for people. These are just some basic ideas of what is going to happen to the evolution of robots – but on a broader scale of the evolution of robots they will be able to perform surgical procedures and robots even built for war purposes.
        <br> However, there is a fear of the technological advancement of robots is that there is a concern; if the artificial intelligence that would be created would eventually allow robots to think on their own. And when humans program them to perform a particular task they could possibly override this and think for themselves and bypass our protection for their own benefit. And the to prevent this from happening the creators of these robotics will need to overcome these obstacles when this new technology will eventually arrive. </p>
        <p>
    <h4>What is the likey impact? </h4>
       In today's society, we are already surrounded by robotics in our own homes such as trusting a machine to cook our toaster or allowing it play music in the car. Most people don't know that they are already exposed to this type of technology, but with the media playing a big role in the evolution of robotics. They portray robots as these human-noid like creatures who destroy the Earth; which in fact is the exact opposite of what they will do they will help and assist us in everyday life - robots will bring the world to us.
      <br> With these new technologies arising robotics will be everywhere. Eventually replacing people's jobs today; for example, taxi drivers will eventually no longer be needed - as self-driving cars will be around and we will be able to order a car when we need to go somewhere. Also, robots will be placed into human society; especially in schools that will assist in learning for children. As this is very beneficial as they will be able to do things that a normal teacher can't do themselves.
      <br>These are just some of the jobs that would be replaced by robots, but many will be created also. The manufacturing of robots will create an influx of job opportunities within in the robotic industry and technology fields etc. So, there might be jobs that we know today that will gone – but will create jobs that us as a society that we haven't even thought of yet. </p>
      <p>
    <h4> How will this affect you? </h4>
      Robotics would have a positive effect on my life. As I am intrigued to learn about robots and what they will be able to do in the future; both on a small and large scales. By completing an Information Technology course at RMIT will allow myself and others in my discipline to be given work that doesn't even exist yet in the technology industry. It will allow us to work alongside robots in this type of industry and give us first look of this technology will be able to do.
      <br> However, this will not be the case for everyone. As I know many people who want to lawyers, teachers and doctors and their jobs that we know in 2018 will be completely different in a few years to come; as most of their jobs will be overridden by robotics. And they will be taught how to work with these robots and be working in a completely different way - mostly beneficial. I also have a few friends that are training for the army and the navy; they would eventually be replaced by robotics who are more equitable for the job; as they are made for the job unlike us as people.
      <br>However, the biggest difficulty for people to accept this new type of technology will be people allowing to live and work alongside robots. As some people will think the complete opposite of what I think about them and those people will have to be shown how this new technology is a good thing and that it will help the human race to grow.</p>
