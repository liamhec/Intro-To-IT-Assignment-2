    <h4> Eliza </h4>
     As a group of five people we all got along well and worked great as a team. Everyone got along and was able to get the work done. The work got spread out evenly between the five of us, and were all able to complete the work at the deadline. As a group, we had no arguments or disagreements, which happens rarely when working in a group this big. All the work was then uploaded up on to a Google Docs, as this was our place to share our work that we have done. The Liam was able to collaborate all the information provided and place it onto a website. We were able to communicate properly and if one person was struggling anyone was happy to help them; face to face and also on a Facebook group chat. In the future, I think we should all meet up outside of the designated tutorials and see how everyone is running outside of the classroom. And also contribute the use of GitHub as well, as we barely used it at all; and because of this I still don't know too much about GitHub. Overall, I think we made a great team that also got the job done in time.

    <h4> Darian </h4>
     As a group, I think we have performed well and worked together cohesively. As a whole, I believe that we all contributed our equal amounts of work and all the work we contributed was to a good standard as well. We all shared our ideas and split up the work so that everyone had an equal amount to do. Individually, I think that my work was up to the standard that we all expected at the beginning of the assignment. I attended all the tutorials where we spent most of the time talking about and working on the assignment. During this assignment I learned a lot, not only about the it world but also a lot about my group members as well. We were had no disagreements on the work we had to do and that surprised me because many of the groups I have worked with in the past normally had at least one thing that we all disagreed on. In the future, we could maybe communicate more outside of the group meetings and work times so that our work exceeds the standards that we all agreed upon. Additionally our github account does not accurately reflect the work that we have done because we used a google doc where we uploaded all of our work to. Overall I believe we not only worked well together but individually as well.

      <h4> Josh </h4>
         Within our group we communicated quite well, making use of technology and communication mediums such as
            Facebook and email we were able to collaboratively report progress and communicate about any queries or issues
            We were having. This allowed us to fluently segment our work and then submit it to our compiler which was Liam.

            One thing that I believe could be improved was the segmenting of the work. Due to the mainly group oriented tasks
            Within the assignment, it required most to be done together. Meanwhile some parts were individual and thus there
            Was not a perfectly distributed workload. However, this was due to the initial planning and was not a clause of any
            Members fault individually.

            One thing that was surprising was the ability of the group to actively utilize the shared google document to collaborate and report progress.

            I have learnt that individually one can only do so much work and within a group the power of numbers allows for greater
            Amounts of work to be completed with a shorter amount of time and to a higher quality.

            The Github logs I believe do not actively reflect our work as we operated mainly from a google document to submit work and the link to the document whilst was in the Github, does not represent the active changes made.

          <h4> Liam </h4>
           During this assignment everyone worked well and was able to complete the work on time, which gave me enough time to compile everything onto the website. As an improvement, we could have used GitHub to gain experience in using this application. We could have also decided to meet up and work on this assignment outside of out tutorials. I learnt a lot about making websites during this assignment, and a lot about various topics covered with the assignment. We all worked well throughout this assignment, which could be due to our organisation with dividing up the work, and the communication between everyone through Facebook messenger. We mainly used google docs in order to share the work we each completed, instead of GitHub. This worked well to have a central place for all of our work, however the use of GitHub could have been good to use, in order to learn new skills. The edit history found in the google doc is a far better representation of the work we completed rather than the GitHub commits.

          <h4> Suhaib </h4>
           Our group consisted of five people that I believe worked well together.   From the get-go we got along well, had friendly discussions, and were able to communicate with each other well without any hesitation.  We were able to divide this assignment into parts we were each comfortable with without any sort of hiccups. However, I couldn't do as much as the others within the group since there weren't enough parts to divide equally. Next time I think I should take the initiative and ask people whether they need help or would like to divide their individual parts to help their workload. I've learned the group work is pretty good. Not that much different from high school. We did not use GitHub throughout the assignment but instead used a Google Doc, and thus we do not have a GitHub trail.

          <h4> Overall Reflection </h4>
          Overall, everyone agreed that we all worked well with each other, and were able to complete our work on time, without arguments. We all got along well with each other and found no issues with the work we had split up and given to each other. We all think that we could improve our use of GitHub, to share the work we had completed. Although this wasn't much of an issue since we used google docs instead, it still could have enabled us to learn how to use a different application to work collaboratively. We also believe it could have been more beneficial if we had met up to work on the assignment together instead of just in our tutorial classes. This could have helped with some of the aspects of the assignment as we could easily work on parts that required information from each other. This could have also helped with the segmentation of work and made it easier to divide up the work equally between everyone. The main thing that was found surprising by the majority of us, was how we worked together. We had no arguments about the work we were creating, and we all got along really well. We all had past experiences with working in groups and were aware of the potential of problems and arguments to arise, however this didn't occur within this project. We all learnt a lot more about the IT industry throughout this assignment. Whether it be about the burning glass data, to how collaboration often works within the IT industry. The main tool we used for working collaboratively was a google doc. This enabled us to easily share the work we had individually worked on, and compile everything together into a central place. The history within this document highlights the individual work we each completed. We had set up a GitHub repository, but this wasn't really used. The main commits made to it, involved the code for the website. We all decided this could be an area for us to improve upon next time, to learn how to use to GitHub, and gain more experience with an application that's used in the IT Industry. Overall, this assignment went well, with all of us learning many things about the IT industry, while being able to easily work with each other.
