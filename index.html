        <h3> Team Profile Test Results </h3>
          <h4> Eliza </h4>
            <p> I completed the online tests: The Myer-Briggs Test, Psychology Today-Big Five Personality Test, Open Source Psychometrics Project Test, Education Planner-Learning Style Test. All the results from each of these tests were all similar to each other and described me perfectly. In all of them I am a social person and would prefer to work in a team than alone. I am an extroverted person and I prefer to learn in a ‘hands on’ type of learning. It was good to see in each of the tests that they provided detailed results about your personality; that even included your strengths and weaknesses and how to overcome them. As all my results were pretty consistent I would hope that employers would look at this and that I am a people person and work well in a team and that I’m not a shy person. And when the job has to get done I will get it done; as this reflects what the results say in the tests I have completed. </p>
            <p>The results suggest that I work best in a team rather than alone. As my personality type thrives off social interaction when working on a project and I know how to express my opinion and ideas when I need to. My communication skills while working in a team so what I am best at, however when working with a team I may not be the best at the practical work but when it comes to presenting our project to an audience I will happily do that. It does suggest though that I might work better in a team but I can easily become stressed e.g. if a project won’t be finished in time. And if I do become stress I can take it out on my teammates – which is something I have to work on (as this has happened before). I might also find it hard to focus working on a project so I would need to take breaks and have a bit of a laugh with my teammates, which might annoy other people in my team- because It can come across that I’m not doing any work- when I actually am. </p>

          <h4> Darian </h4>
            <p> The test results show that I am a sociable person and able to work in teams. My learning style is visual which indicates that I would be better suited for work involving creating a presentation or something. From the “Big Five Personality” test, I learned that my personality is outgoing and optimistic which would be good for group work as I will get along with and encourage my group to do a good job. Working in a group project would be one of my strong points as I really believe I would be able to work well with others. When finding a group I think it would be a good choice to find group members with better individual skills as I believe it would be better to balance out the group. Someone who is able to grasp new ideas and apply them would also be beneficial to the group as they can explain new ways to solve problems as that is one of my weak points. </p>
            <p> The results that this test displayed show that my personality test is quite outgoing. My highest scoring factor (agreeableness) show that I am easy to get along with, friendly and optimistic. Additionally, my second highest scoring factor shows that I am more sociable than others. On the other hand, the lower scoring factors show that I tend to tackle problems in a way that I am comfortable with and have difficulty in attempting to learn new methods. </p>

          <h4> Joshua </h4>

          <h4> Liam </h4>
            <p> Looking at all the test results I feel as though they do reflect upon my personality. It highlights the need for me to focus on fixing issues, such as not procrastinating, and developing my social skills. The results also reinforce a few things that I’m aware of, such as the way I learn by doing things, rather than just listening. My organisation skills I feel are good which is shown but could be improved which is also highlighted with these results. So, these results have identified some areas in which I can further myself. </p>
            <p> Highlighted in the Myer-Briggs test, the hard work and dedication I can put into a project can be beneficial in a team. This paired with the dependability that’s shown, I feel will make a good combination in a team, as it suggests I will get the work done for the project without any issues. However, the procrastination suggested by the Big 5 Personality test somewhat contradicts this. This is an area which I’m aiming to improve, and I feel as though that I wouldn’t let the rest of my team down. </p>

          <h4> Suhaib </h4>
            <p> To assist potential employees regarding my employability, I took three online tests. The Myers-Briggs test indicated that my type is ENTJ. (Extravert 59%, Intuitive 43%, Thinking 22%, Judging 33%) An online test that defines your learning style scored me as a visual learner. For the third online test I chose a creativity test that can be found at (thecreativityquiz.com) that ranked me 81/100 points which is incredibly creative. These test results to me mean that to employees, it’ll show them that I am very sociable, and that I’m good at communication. The learning test means that to be able top learn things in the workplace I’d need to be trained visually, as in seeing someone perform the task so that I can learn myself. The creativity test means that I’m very creative, and this’ll entice employers seeing as that I can come up with new ideas and projects on the go. These test results will have an impact on a team due to my personality. I’m very outgoing, and hence will be very talkative and interactive with the team. I’m also very creative which would help the team in thinking about ideas, projects, and problem solving. When forming a team, I should consider myself being an extrovert. The people in the team also need to possess good communication skills. However, I should pick up people that are very high in thinking and have good judgment to complement what I lack.
