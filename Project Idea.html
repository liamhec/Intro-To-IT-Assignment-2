    <h1> Project Idea </h1>
       For our project idea, our group has decided to go with an app that manages money and finances. As a group we discussed that an app that would be ideal to have would be an app that would allow us to keep track of and manage our money. The concept of the app is a simple one but the impact that it will have on our everyday lives would be huge. The app would have many features, it would allow its users to keep track of their money, how it is spent and also where the money is spent as well. In our society today, it is difficult to save our money due to the fact that we are usually unaware of where our money goes. </br>

      <br> The app would work by collecting information on your day to day spending, whether it be from cash purchases or debit transactions, the app would encourage you to input your days spending in. Along with each input, the app will additionally ask you to make a comment about the purchase as well, this will assist the user in determining what the purchase was. This data will be stored within the phone and be recalled whenever the user wants to see their transaction history. This would help the users save money by allowing them to pinpoint where they spend a majority of money. Ideally, this app would be able to be linked with your bank account. Banking apps such as the Westpac bank apps have transaction records as well but it is not to the extent that our group want. The transaction records for banking apps do not have a lot of detail in explaining what the purchase was and as a result the consumer is often left thinking about what it is they spent their money on. However with our app you will be able to link your bank details and it will record all the purchases made with your debit card and have a detailed explanation on what your money was spent on. Additionally, if you have multiple bank accounts, you will be able to link them all onto the app, regardless if they are from different banks. This means that all your money will be shown in one spot which is useful as it doesn't require you to constantly check with each bank to see how much money you have in each one.
    </br>

      <br> The app that we hope to create will also be free for everyone. In our current age, high quality financing and money management is vital to our economy. There are many people who are not able to access any form of finance management and as a result, our economy is not where it should be. Because of the global financial crisis, the public lost trust with the world's financial systems, and with our app, we hope to build the public's trust up again. Since the crisis, many have opted to find other ways to finance and these methods are often expensive. Statistics show that roughly 2 billion people do not have access to basic finance management and it is time for this to change, with the introduction of our app we aim to give free access to a basic form of finance management. If we are successful, our economy as a whole is likely to become healthier and as a result the rates of poverty will drop, additionally unemployment rates will drop as well.

      <br> Our project idea aims to create an app that helps individuals finance and manage their money. Not only will our idea allow people a free tool to use for their finances but from using our smartphone app, our economy will be able to flourish as well. Poverty and unemployment rates will drop as a result of our economy being the best that it can. </p>
