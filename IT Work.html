      <h4> What kind of work is done by the IT Professional? </h4>
        The IT professional interviewed was Eliza's dad named Chris Pingiaro. He is currently a Senior Project Manager at Australian Catholic University. The main role of a senior project manager is to organise, control and lead a group(s) of multiple people to effectively get a project completed. These projects can vary in how people are in the project manager's team and the severity (how much money is funded and how the money is used effectively) of the project being accomplished. Project Managers don't always choose their teams and anyone kind of person can be a part of their team â€“ different strengths and weaknesses. There are usually multiple teams completing different tasks to complete the project as a hole. The project manager meets with all the different teams in regular schedule meetings to make sure they are meeting the deadlines lines given and how they are going with the work to make sure they complete the project on time in a smooth manner; usually projects run for about 1-2 months and projects that have a larger budget usually take longer. Their job is make sure that the project is designed, built, tested and implemented all within a specific time frame.

      <h4> What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h4>
         Chris works with all sorts of people. Being in a senior role means you spend more time communicating with people rather than behind a computer doing technical work. He meets with all sorts of people in relation to the project that he is currently managing. So, this can vary from business people, CFO, CEO, operating officers, managers, support, security and student services. Working in the education department his main source of feedback when a project is being the students - as they are implementing projects to benefit them. So, he also spends most of times with students and student services to get the information he needs. </p>
         <p>
      <h4> Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h4>
         Chris spends most of his time in the office of ACU located in Melbourne as his team is located here and most of days are spent in meetings or communicating with people. Being a more senior role he has the flexibility to work from home/be away on a holiday and work from a secondary location - and if he is needed he will be contacted either skype or a phone call.  </p>
         <p>
      <h4>What aspect of their position is most challenging? </h4>
         Chris find its most challenging is being able to communicate properly and when getting a message across that he is able to make sure everyone understands what he is saying. Being able to effectively communicate properly and make sure his team is all on the same page is can sometimes be difficult.
        <br>Also, the larger funded projects that Chris might have to deal with as they take a lot longer to complete and a lot more challenging to accomplish - as it could involve a larger team such as 30+ people to lead. Having an enterprise with large value is also difficult to make sure the team he is leading and other people he has to deal with is running smoothly and to make sure everyone is happy.</p>
