    <h2> Job Titles </h2>

    <p>
   <h4> Eliza </h4>
     <h4> Cybersecurity Surveillance Officer </h4>
        Furthermore, Eliza's ideal job is to be a Surveillance officer at ASIO. Whilst this job is the most specific title out of the group, it can be simplified into a similar category as Joshua's. Due to the fact the role of the surveillance officer specified by ASIO requires knowledge of security threats, prevention and analysis it would also fall under the role of Cybersecurity. Thus, whilst the magnitude of jobs within the industry is not as great as the software engineering aspects of both Suhaib's and Liam's ideal job, the needs for people who can satisfy the position are not being met within Australia, as 55.7% of the jobs available for this title have not been fulfilled due to a shortage of education within the area. </p>

        <p>
        <h4> Darian </h4>
          <h4> Web Software Engineer </h4>
            Within the past year the role of a web developer according to Burning Glass Technologies' data has also been within the bracket of high demand. In comparison to the needs of both Liam's ideal job it is not in such great demand, however, the active positions available for web developers within Australia and New Zealand greatly outweigh the needs of Eliza and Joshua's ideal jobs as within the past year there were 381 web developer positions available. Thereby, making the position the 15th most in demand within the local IT industry in recent times. </p>

      <p>
      <h4> Joshua </h4>
        <h4> Principal Penetration Tester  </h4>
            Whilst Joshua's job although a necessity for most businesses, was not a large industry for jobs within Australia. This is due to the fact that it is more of a reactive and proactive solution to handling security issues within medium to large businesses. Thus, the need for penetration testers and more over Cyber security professionals is not as large as say programmers and computational developers. Currently in Australia the demand for people with high levels of Cyber security skills is only being satisfied by 42.3%, with a further 55.7% of jobs within the industry not being satisfied. </p>

      <p>
      <h4> Liam </h4>
        <h4> Java Software Engineer </h4>
           In regards to Liam's ideal job as a Java software engineer, there is a much greater demand. According to Burning Glass Technologies, for the first quarter of 2017 there were 713 postings in search of Java developers within Australia/New Zealand. This job title iterating itself at the 7th most required job within the start of 2017 within the information technology industry thereby shows great demand for Java developers. Compared to Joshua's selection of the information security and Cybersecurity aspect of the IT world, Liam's ideal job title out weights Joshua's in order of magnitude and need. </p>

       <p>
      <h4> Suhaib </h4>
        <h4> Senior Software Engineer </h4>
           Suhaib's ideal job is to be a senior software Engineer, this job in particular revolves around many forms of programming and languages. The position of a senior software engineer in regards to Burning Glass Technologies within the first quarter of 2017 ranks as the 16th most required occupation for companies within Australia and New Zealand within the IT sector. With 371 active positions available, the demand for this job is quite high and in comparison to Joshua's ideal job, overlaps its demand entirely. However, as the job is more similar to Liam's ideal job the comparison between the two is much more relative. Whilst Liam's more general role as a Java developer is in high demand as companies may need a few of the same language developer to develop things such as programs and applications, Suhaib's preference is much more specific as it identifies as a senior position. This requires ideally more practise within the industry and also the ability to overlook all facets of software engineering. </p>

    <h2> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h2>

      With regards to my idea job (Joshua's) my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. As stated within my assignment 1 text, I acknowledged that getting to the level of a penetration tester is a long goat. The job in particular requires previous skills and education within all facets of IT. It was of my previous acknowledgement that this would be the case and I said that I was willing to do so. The difficult nature of the learning curve support the data shown by indeed.com which states that 55.7% of the security jobs within Australia have not been fulfilled by employees due to the lack of skill in the area. However, again this is personally not a deterrent as the long journey is what was personally so enticing as it allows for a large amount of knowledge to be gained and extrapolated on.
